    "# FIZZ-BUZZ GAME CODE\n",
    "1.User Input: Prompt the user to input the upper limit for the FizzBuzz game (e.g., 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Implementation: Write a loop that iterates through the numbers from 1 to the specified limit and applies the FizzBuzz rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Conditionals: Use conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine whether a number is a multiple of 3, 5, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Output: Display the numbers along with the appropriate replacements (\"Fizz,\" \"Buzz,\" or \"FizzBuzz\") based on the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Code Organization: Write clean and well-organized code with comments explaining each step of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"FizzBuzz Game in Python\" project is a classic programming exercise that focuses on conditionals and looping constructs. The game involves printing numbers from 1 to a specified limit, with certain rules applied to some numbers. Specifically, numbers that are multiples of 3 are replaced with \"Fizz,\" numbers that are multiples of 5 are replaced with \"Buzz,\" and numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 are replaced with \"FizzBuzz.\" This project is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills and learn how to structure conditional logic and loops effectively."
